# NQueens

This is a freelance project I made that solves the Nqueens problem given a chessboard size.

## Prerequisites
This assumes you have git and a C compiler (like gcc) installed.

## Installation

``git clone https://github.com/bohnerjosh/NQueens/edit/main/README.md && cd NQueens``

## Configure
To set the board size, open ``main.c`` with your favorite command line text editor and modify the BOARD_LENGTH variable to the n x n board size you would like.

## Running

First, compile.

``gcc main.c``

Then, run it.

``./a.out``
